# graphql-apollo-client-course

In order to run the client you need to seed the DB and run the server.

```
cd server
npm run seed
npm run start:slow
```

You can find the server located here: https://github.com/nikgraf/graphql-apollo-client-course/tree/master/server

The db is two JSON files stored in `/tmp/recipes.json` and `/tmp/ingedients.json`.
